# Camellia Wiki - Frontend
The curtain in front of the magic.

## Getting Started
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). Ensure [NPM](https://npmjs.com) is included.
> You may install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) as your package manager instead.

To begin development and testing locally, please follow these steps in your terminal of choice:
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/FlowerShaper/wiki-frontend`.
2. Go inside the newly cloned folder (`cd wiki-frontend`).
3. To install packages, run `npm i` (if using PNPM, run `pnpm i`).
4. Now, to run the frontend, you'll need to run one of the following scripts, depending on the case:
   - **Development**: `npm run dev`
   - **Production**: `npm run build`
